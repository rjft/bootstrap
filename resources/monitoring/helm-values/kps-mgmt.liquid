    # incoming metrics from workload clusters will have a cluster label set to the cluster handle, but that's only assigned at the remote write push
    # the mgmt cluster itself will not have a cluster label set, one can use an external label, but that's only added on push time
    # ideally we would have a scrape class that would add a cluster label to all targets scraped by prometheus, this is currently not supported, but will be with probably the next release of the prometheus operator
    # in the meantime we add relabel config to all servicemonitors individually (see below)
    # this is how it would look like:
    # use scrape classes in the future to add a cluster label to all targets scraped by prometheus
    # this will make sure we can always identify the cluster a target belongs to, even for the mgmt cluster prometheus
